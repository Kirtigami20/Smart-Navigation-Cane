# Smart-Navigation-Cane
Smart Navigation Cane is an IoT-based assistive device for visually impaired users. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby obstacles and alerts the user through a vibration motor. An SOS button with a GPS module sends real-time location to a web app using Flask and ThingSpeak for emergency assistance.
